   Changelog for files within xv6
------------------------------------
    * defs.h
	|--- Modified to include required declarations from project
	|    specification, as well as swap file manipulation functions.
	|
	|--- Added definitions of swap tracker manipulation functions.
	|
	|--- Added declaration of walkpgdir, defined in vm.c

    * sysfile.c
	|--- Required modifications according to project specification;
	     static declarations removed from create() and isdirempty().

    * fs.c
	|--- Appended provided swap file manipulation code.

    * proc.h
	|--- Modifications to proc structure (for swapped page tracking),
	|    definition of swapped page tracking struct (struct swapp),
	|    addition of paging state variables
	|
	|--- NOTE: struct swapp is now a wrapper for unsigned integers,
	|	   and thus all manipulations or comparisions
	|	   of the swapped page addresses should be done with
	|	   unsigned integers.
	|
	|--- Added implementations for swap tracker manipulation:
	|	|--- stinit(struct proc *p)
	|	|--- add_page(void *va, struct proc *p)
	|	|--- remove_page(void *va, struct proc *p) 
	|
	|--- Added macro EMPTY (0xFFFFFFFF) as a sentinal value
	|    for unused swap space indice addresses

    * proc.c
	|--- Contains call (in exit() method) for closing and removing
	     process' swap file. 

    * mmu.h
	|--- Modification to include "swapped out" flag (PTE_PG).
	|
	|--- Added user process page limitation MAX_PSYC_PAGES (15)
	|    and MAX_TOTAL_PAGES (30) macros

    * exec.c
	|--- Contains call to createSwapFile() for new processes that are
	     not "sh" or "init".
 
    * Makefile
	|--- Added rule for SELECTION flag to specifiy page replacement
	     algorithm per task 2.
