   Status   
------------
* In its current form, this implementation does not function. Debug
prints are included in this submission to display the extent of
functionality.

* The project experiences three forms of crashes, with varying degrees
of regularity:

	(1) When starting up, a popcli() panic is issued.
	    This is uncommon.

	(2) Once the user is prompted for a command, issuing
	    any command will lead to a remap() panic as the
	    kernel memory is mapped into the new process'
	    page table. Currently, this issue is slightly
	    uncommon.

	(3) Once the user is prompted for a command, issuing
	    any command will lead to a successful mapping of
	    the kernel's memory; after this, copyuvm() will
	    run briefly before QEMU crashes on an invalid
	    RAM/ROM access. This issue is most common.
